# Rule Enforcement

Mechanical, manifest-driven enforcement of the global rules in `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`, so compliance does not depend on recall. Every mechanizable rule is enforced by a hook or the bundled linter; the irreducibly-judgment rules are checked by an LLM judge at the push boundary.

## Why

Rules that had automation behind them (the em-dash hook, Prettier) never slipped. Rules re-listed from memory per task did. This system gives every mechanizable rule the em-dash property: it fires every time, independent of memory.

## Manifest

`manifest.json` is the single source of enforcement *mapping*. Rule *text* stays in the rule files (one-line norms in `CLAUDE.md`, full Specs in `rulebook/reference.md`) and is never duplicated here. The enforcement guard and the LLM judge read rule text from `rulebook/reference.md`. Each entry:

```json
{ "id": "R-323", "tier": "ast", "enforcer": "eslint:sort-keys", "severity": "error", "autofix": true }
```

## Tiers

| Tier | Enforced by | When | Examples |
|------|-------------|------|----------|
| `regex` | a hook doing cheap path/string checks | per edit (Write/Edit) or per Bash call | R-312, R-306, R-311, R-103 |
| `ast` | the bundled ESLint config (`lint.mjs`) run by `push-eslint-gate.sh` | per push | R-323, R-321, R-319, R-326, R-324, R-303 |
| `llm-judge` | `llm-rule-judge.sh` (a fast model over the diff) | per push | R-315, R-316, R-317, R-322, R-318, R-325, R-320 |
| `advisory` | a non-blocking warning or confirm prompt (reminder, push-time stderr, or `ask`) | per edit or per push | R-310, R-309, R-506, R-513, R-801 |

Per-edit checks must stay cheap (no Node, no network). All heavy work (ESLint, the model call) runs once per push.

## Per-repo config: `.enforce.json`

Some rules are repo-specific. A repo may place an optional `.enforce.json` at its root; the global engine reads it (the push gate `cd`s to the repo root first). It is data, not a hook, so "global hooks only" still holds.

```json
{
  "importZones": [
    { "target": "src/services", "from": "src/handlers", "message": "services must not import handlers (R-303)" }
  ],
  "singleFileFolderExemptions": ["src/services/auth", "src/services/email"]
}
```

- `importZones` (R-303): drives ESLint `import/no-restricted-paths`. Files under `target` may not import from `from`. Paths are relative to the repo root. With no zones, import-direction is not enforced.
- `singleFileFolderExemptions` (R-309): folders that are allowed to hold a single source module (e.g. the portfolio project's intentional single-file service folders, which override R-309 by project convention).

## Push gate scope

The push gates are an **anti-accident layer**, not a hard security boundary. They fire when Claude Code runs `git push` via the Bash tool and intercepts the PreToolUse hook. They are evadable by running git directly in a terminal, using shell aliases, or passing `-c core.hooksPath=/dev/null`. The goal is to catch rule violations committed in the normal Claude Code workflow, not to enforce policy against a determined actor.

**New-branch behaviour:** when a branch has no remote tracking ref and no `@{push}` ref exists, the push gate resolves a merge-base fallback (first existing of `origin/main`, `main`, `origin/master`, `master`). On a first push from a brand-new branch with none of those reachable, the gate fails open (skips the check) to avoid blocking legitimate work.

## Components

- `manifest.json` -- rule id to tier/enforcer mapping.
- `eslint.config.mjs` + `rules/` -- bundled flat config and custom rules.
- `lint.mjs` -- runs the config against any absolute file path via the ESLint Node API (`cwd:/`), so files in any repo are in scope. Invoked by the push gate.
- `eslintOptions.mjs` -- builds the ESLint options shared by `lint.mjs` and `ratchet.mjs`, including the two opt-in rules. Both must activate the identical rule set or the baseline counts violations the push gate never reports.
- `lexicon.json` -- the naming registry backing R-316 and half of R-317.
- `ratchet.mjs` -- full-tree violation baseline (see below).
- `judge-prompt.md` -- instructions for the semantic-rule judge.
- `tests/` -- one fixture test per enforcer; `run-tests.sh` runs them all.
- Hooks live in `~/.claude/hooks/` and are registered in `~/.claude/settings.json`.
- `enforcement-guard-check.sh` verifies at session start that every manifest hook is still registered.

## Adding a rule

1. Add the one-line norm to `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` and the full Spec block to `~/.claude/rulebook/reference.md`.
2. Add a `manifest.json` entry: pick a tier and name its enforcer.
3. Ship the enforcer (extend an existing hook, add an ESLint rule, or add the rule id to the judge tier) AND a fixture test under `tests/`. A rule with no manifest entry is unenforced and depends on recall.

## Running the tests

```
bash ~/.claude/enforce/tests/run-tests.sh
```

## Repo exemptions

Repos listed by origin remote URL (one per line, exact match) in `exempt-repos.txt` are treated as team codebases where this operator's personal gates do not govern. Matching is by remote URL, so every worktree of a listed repo is covered.

Two hooks honour the list:

- `push-eslint-gate.sh` (added 2026-07-22): the repo's own lint conventions govern instead.
- `audit-signal-check.sh` (added 2026-07-27): repo-wide audit signals are noise in a team codebase, where per-surface commit counts reflect the whole team's work rather than one operator's. Branch-scoped audits stay available on request; only the automatic push-time nudge is suppressed.

`exempt-repos.txt` is deliberately untracked: it holds client-identifying remote URLs and this repo is public (R-106). The hooks that read it are tracked; the list itself is not.

## The naming lexicon (R-316, R-317)

"Is this a good name" is undecidable. "Is this verb in the lexicon" is set membership. `lexicon.json` is that set, so the check is a pure function of `(AST, config)` and gives the same verdict on every machine and every run.

It decides: the leading word of a named function is an approved verb or a boolean prefix; a noun follows it; the verb is not a banned synonym (the report names the canonical replacement); a function annotated `: boolean` leads with `is`/`has`/`can`/`should`; with a glossary configured, the head noun is a declared domain term. For variables it decides two things only: a collection is named in the plural, and a single-word name is not a bare adjective.

It does not decide whether the lexicon carves the domain well, nor R-318/R-322 (one responsibility), which are undecidable and stay with the judge rather than being faked with a line-count proxy.

`lexicon.json` and the R-316 Spec bullet in `rulebook/reference.md` are one rule in two forms. Edit them together.

Opt in per repo, because the vocabulary is the repo's:

```json
{
  "naming": {
    "enabled": true,
    "glossary": ["note", "job", "resume"],
    "extend": { "verbs": ["score", "tailor"] }
  }
}
```

A top-level list (`verbs`, `bannedVerbs`, `bareAdjectives`, `irregularPlurals`) replaces the shipped one; `extend` adds to it. Omitting `glossary` skips head-noun checking rather than passing it. A repo with no `naming` key gets exactly the behavior it had before the rule existed. Tests, fixtures, mocks, `e2e/`, and `.d.ts` are exempt. PascalCase is skipped, so React components and classes are untouched.

## The ratchet (long-term enforcement)

A diff-scoped gate leaves the untouched majority of a codebase free to drift, and turning a rule on across a legacy tree in one pass is a refactor nobody schedules. `ratchet.mjs` runs every rule over every tracked `.ts`/`.tsx` file, records the count per rule in a committed `.enforce-baseline.json`, and fails when a count RISES. Existing debt is grandfathered; new debt is not; the number only ever descends.

```
node ~/.claude/enforce/ratchet.mjs            # check against the baseline
node ~/.claude/enforce/ratchet.mjs --update   # write or lock in the baseline, then commit it
node ~/.claude/enforce/ratchet.mjs --strict   # also fail on improvements not yet locked in
```

Counts errors only; warnings are advisory and would make the gate fail on advice. The baseline has sorted keys and no timestamp, so a re-run on an unchanged tree is byte-identical: no diff churn, no clock-driven merge conflicts.

Run it as a required status check on the protected branch. A local hook is `--no-verify`-able, which makes it advisory no matter how it is written; determinism needs the check to run where it cannot be skipped.

Known limit, stated rather than hidden: the gate compares per-rule totals, so deleting one violation and adding another under the same rule nets to zero and passes. Per-file keying would catch that and would churn on every rename. Totals are the deliberate trade, and the push gate (`lint.mjs --added-only`) is what catches the newly added line.
