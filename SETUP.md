# Setup

How to install this `~/.claude` configuration on a new machine or hand it to someone else. The framework (rules, hooks, audit roles, skills, convention tracks) is generic; personal data and secrets do not ship and are recreated locally.

## Prerequisites

- **git** and **bash** (macOS or Linux; on Windows use WSL, the hooks are bash).
- **jq** is required. Every PreToolUse and SessionStart hook parses its input with `jq`; without it the hooks fail. Install with `brew install jq` or your package manager.
- **node** is required by the clean-code scanner (`hooks/clean-code-scan.mjs`) and the ESLint push gate (`enforce/lint.mjs`).
- **python3** is needed by `ntfy-notify.sh`, the manifest closure test, and the latency test's clock.
- Optional per stack, all fail open when absent at runtime: **ruff** (or uv), **rubocop**, **golangci-lint** for the Python/Ruby/Go push gates.
- **ruff is not optional to run the fixture suite**, however. `push-ruff-gate.test.sh` drives the real binary, while the RuboCop and golangci fixtures stub their linters through `CLAUDE_RUBOCOP_CMD` / `CLAUDE_GOLANGCI_CMD`. Without ruff on PATH that one test fails on a missing tool rather than on a defect, which is what the first CI runs did. Install it (`pipx install ruff`) or expect that single failure.
- **Claude Code** itself.

## Install

1. Clone this repo to `~/.claude` (the hooks and `settings.json` reference `~/.claude/...` paths, so the location matters).
2. Reinstall plugins: they are managed by Claude Code and reinstalled from `settings.json` (`enabledPlugins`); the `plugins/` directory is gitignored.
3. Install the git-side files that `.git/` cannot carry itself:
   - `bash ~/.claude/hooks/install-git-hooks.sh` writes `.git/hooks/pre-push` from the tracked `hooks/pre-push.sample`, so a red suite aborts any push. It refuses to clobber a pre-push it did not write, printing the exact `mv` to run if you want it replaced; its own superseded predecessor is the one hook it upgrades in place, backed up to `pre-push.legacy.bak` first. This step used to be "write a bash script that does X", and the script it described was simply absent from the checkout; the sample is tracked now so the description cannot drift from it.
   - `.git/info/exclude`: local-only exclusions for anything client-identifying that must never be tracked (versioned `.gitignore` covers the standard runtime dirs).
4. Regenerate the hook-integrity manifest so it matches your checkout: `hooks/hook-integrity-check.sh --update`, then commit `enforce/hook-hashes.txt` if it changed.
5. Start a Claude Code session. The SessionStart hooks load the global memory index, verify hook integrity, report enforcement closure (including whether the llm-judge tier can run; see the egress disclosure in README.md), and warn on a `core.hooksPath` that points outside the repo (R-107).

## What does not ship (gitignored) and must be recreated

| Path | What it is | On a fresh install |
|---|---|---|
| `.env`, `.env.*` | Secrets (API keys, notify config) | Recreate by hand; never commit (R-102) |
| `settings.local.json` | Machine-specific permissions/overrides | Recreate as needed |
| `KNOWN-ISSUES.md` | Production incident log | Copy from `KNOWN-ISSUES.template.md`, then populate |
| `projects/` | Per-project session memory | Auto-created per project; starts empty |
| `plugins/`, caches, `sessions/`, `uploads/`, `history.jsonl` | Ephemeral Claude Code state | Auto-managed |

## Reset for a clean handoff

The framework files (`CLAUDE.md`, `PROTOCOL.md`, rules, hooks, agents, skills, convention tracks) are already free of personal and single-project identifiers. The one tracked personal store is `global-memory/`:

- `global-memory/feedback_*.md` and `global-memory/lesson_*.md` are reusable collaboration and efficiency defaults. Keep, edit, or delete them to taste.
- `global-memory/rule_fires.md` and `global-memory/rule_misses.md` are incident logs from the previous owner's sessions. Truncate each to its header so you accumulate your own.
- `global-memory/INDEX.md` indexes the above; update it after editing.

## Stacks

Four convention tracks load on demand by detected stack (see `rules/session-types.md`):

- **TypeScript/Node** (`package.json`): `CLAUDE-BACKEND.md`, `CLAUDE-FRONTEND.md` (plus `CLAUDE-FRONTEND-NEXT.md` or `CLAUDE-FRONTEND-VITE.md` per the framework), `CLAUDE-DATABASE.md`, `CLAUDE-STYLING.md`. The `[ts]`-tagged rules in `CLAUDE.md` apply here.
- **Python** (`pyproject.toml` / `requirements.txt` / `setup.py`): `CLAUDE-PYTHON.md`.
- **Ruby on Rails** (`Gemfile`): `CLAUDE-RUBY.md`.
- **Go** (`go.mod`): `CLAUDE-GO.md`.

Universal rules in `CLAUDE.md` (untagged) apply to every stack; each track documents its analogs of the `[ts]`-tagged rules and its blessed exceptions.

## Verify the install

Run BOTH fixture suites; all tests should pass:

```
bash ~/.claude/enforce/tests/run-tests.sh
bash ~/.claude/hooks/tests/run-tests.sh
```

The same two suites run in CI (`.github/workflows/enforce.yml`, job `fixtures`). Name that job as a required status check under Settings > Branches so the gate runs where it cannot be skipped: the local pre-push hook is `--no-verify`-able and is therefore advisory however it is written.

The ESLint-backed tests in the first suite need `enforce/node_modules`, which is
gitignored and therefore absent from a fresh clone. Run `npm install` in
`~/.claude/enforce` first, or six tests fail on a missing ESLint.

## The turn-level verification gate (R-509)

`hooks/verification-gate.sh` runs on `Stop` and blocks the turn from ending on a
red suite. It discovers this project's own checks rather than hardcoding any,
first match wins: `.claude/verify.sh`, then the `~/.claude` repo's two fixture
suites, then `package.json` `test` plus `typecheck`/`type-check`, then
`pytest`/`mypy`, then `go test`/`go vet`, then `bundle exec rspec`.

- It runs only when the working tree is dirty or the branch carries unpushed
  commits, so read-only turns cost nothing.
- A repo with no discoverable check command is never blocked.
- To give a project its own command, write `.claude/verify.sh` in its root. That
  wins over all discovery, so per-project commands never belong in the hook.
- `CLAUDE_SKIP_VERIFY=1` bypasses for one turn. `CLAUDE_VERIFY_TIMEOUT` (default
  600s) caps each command.

## Cursor and OpenAI Codex

The same rules and hooks reach Cursor and OpenAI Codex through two sibling
repositories generated out of this one: `cursor-global-rules` is cloned at
`~/.cursor` and `openai-global-rules` at `~/.codex`.

First time only, on the machine that holds `~/.claude`: create the two
repositories on GitHub (empty, no README), build each port into its
directory, and push the first build. Both tools keep their own state in those
directories, so the build goes into the existing directory and the
allowlist `.gitignore` it writes keeps that state out of the repository:

```
gh repo create nullvoidundefined/cursor-global-rules --private
gh repo create nullvoidundefined/openai-global-rules --private
node ~/.claude/cursor/build.mjs --write && cd ~/.cursor && git init -q && git add -A && \
  git commit -q -m "feat: initial build from claude-global-rules" && git branch -M main && \
  git remote add origin git@github.com:nullvoidundefined/cursor-global-rules.git && git push -u origin main
node ~/.claude/openai/build.mjs --write && cd ~/.codex && git init -q && git add -A && \
  git commit -q -m "feat: initial build from claude-global-rules" && git branch -M main && \
  git remote add origin git@github.com:nullvoidundefined/openai-global-rules.git && git push -u origin main
```

On every other machine, the clone goes into the existing directory rather
than replacing it:

```
for pair in "cursor cursor-global-rules" "codex openai-global-rules"; do
  set -- $pair
  mkdir -p "$HOME/.$1" && cd "$HOME/.$1" && git init -q && \
    git remote add origin "git@github.com:nullvoidundefined/$2.git" && \
    git fetch -q origin && git checkout -b main origin/main
done
```

The checked-in `.gitignore` in each is an allowlist: only the generated files
are tracked, so `auth.json`, `config.toml`, sessions, and logs stay local even
after `git add -A`. To update after a pull of `~/.claude`:

```
node ~/.claude/cursor/build.mjs --write     # rewrites ~/.cursor
node ~/.claude/openai/build.mjs --write     # rewrites ~/.codex
cd ~/.cursor && git add -A && git commit -m "chore: rebuild from claude-global-rules" && git push
cd ~/.codex  && git add -A && git commit -m "chore: rebuild from claude-global-rules" && git push
```

Each build refuses to overwrite a file it did not write (an existing hand-made
`~/.codex/AGENTS.md` is the usual case: move it aside, or pass `--force`),
records what it wrote in `.claude-port.json`, and reports drift with
`--check`. Then restart Cursor and check Settings > Rules and Settings > Hooks;
in Codex run `/hooks` to review and trust the hook entries (trust is per
content hash, so every rebuild that changes a hook needs a fresh trust) and
`/skills` to see the skills. If a Cursor build does not read a user-level
rules directory, `node ~/.claude/cursor/build.mjs --write --project <repo>`
builds into that repo's `.cursor/` instead. `cursor/README.md` and
`openai/README.md` carry the per-event fidelity tables and the caveats; each
target's `PORT-STATUS.md` the per-hook table.
