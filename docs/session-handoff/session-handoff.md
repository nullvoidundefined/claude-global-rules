# Session Handoff: 2026-09-04 Configuration Audit and Determinism Pass

## 1. Last commit

- `04dd4f5` feat(plugins): enable i-have-adhd always-on across every session (#5)
- Merged from this session's work: #2 (`b1a1241`) and #3 (`7b55cdf`). Landed separately afterwards, not from this session: #4 (`bd604c7`, install-git-hooks now upgrades a superseded pre-push in place instead of refusing, with a fixture) and #5 (`04dd4f5`).

## 2. Production state

- **Live.** Merged, pulled to `~/.claude`, dependencies installed, git hooks installed, and `/context` and `/hooks` run and confirmed by Ian. This is the one thing the session could not verify itself: the work was done in a remote container where the repo sits outside `~/.claude`, so `settings.json` was never loaded by the session that wrote it.
- Both fixture suites green: 38 enforcement, 12 hook. Green in CI on `main` (`.github/workflows/enforce.yml`, job `fixtures`). The twelfth hook fixture arrived with #4.
- Also shipped, in `nullvoidundefined/doppelscript`: `88cee3c` cuts GitHub Actions spend (see section 4).

## 3. What shipped

**Turn-level test gate (R-509).** `hooks/verification-gate.sh`, a `Stop` hook. Discovers the project's own checks (`.claude/verify.sh`, then this repo's two suites, then `package.json` test/typecheck, pytest/mypy, go test/vet, rspec). Runs only when the tree is dirty or the branch carries unpushed commits. Silent on success; blocks with the failing command's real output. Fails open when nothing is discoverable. `CLAUDE_SKIP_VERIFY=1` bypasses. Closes the hole where four push gates linted and nothing ran tests.

**Naming as data (R-316, R-317).** `enforce/lexicon.json` plus `enforce/rules/naming-lexicon.mjs`. Decides verb membership, the mandatory noun, banned synonyms with their canonical replacement, boolean prefixes, and the glossary head noun. Read and persistence verbs are bound to the R-304 layer that gives them meaning (`fetch` under clients/api, `load` under repositories/database/config/prompts, `get` elsewhere; `insert`/`upsert`/`drop` reserved to the persistence trees), so synonyms cannot be freely substituted. Opt-in per repo via the `naming` key in `.enforce.json`.

**The registry is the single source.** `enforce/renderLexiconSpec.mjs` generates the R-316 verb lists in `rulebook/reference.md` between `<!-- lexicon:begin -->` markers. `--check` fails on divergence, `--write` reconciles and is idempotent. `validateLexicon()` additionally rejects a registry that contradicts itself (a banned verb still bound to a layer by `verbGroups` or `scopeVerbs`). Covered by `lexicon-spec-sync.test.sh`.

**Long-term drift (the ratchet).** `enforce/ratchet.mjs`. Full-tree counts per rule against a committed `.enforce-baseline.json`; fails when a count rises. Sorted keys, no timestamp, so repeated runs are byte-identical. `--update` locks in; `--strict` also fails on unlocked improvements.

**Two rules off the judge.** `enforce/rules/destructure-object-reads.mjs` (R-325, default-on) and `enforce/rules/file-header-comment.mjs` (R-320, opt-in via `fileHeaders`). Both were previously decided by nothing.

**Two rules honestly reclassified.** R-318 and R-322 left the llm-judge tier. Both are undecidable; the only deterministic checks available are proxies that enforce a different rule under the original rule's id. R-318 is now `[manual]`, R-322 keeps its advisory nudge. The judge tier is now exactly R-315, R-316, R-317.

**CLAUDE.md pruned.** 118 lines / 15,129 chars to 100 lines / 11,738 chars. 17 conditional rules moved to the new `structure-conventions` skill, every one still caught mechanically at the tool call. `claude-md-lint.test.sh` extended: a norm line may live in `CLAUDE.md` or a skill, and a rule carried in both now fails.

**New agent and skills.** `agents/spec-conformance-review.md` (diff against a named spec, R-804 output discipline, literal "No gaps found."). `skills/spec-grounding` (grounds an externally written spec via read-only subagents). `skills/structure-conventions`.

**CI and the pre-push installer.** `.github/workflows/enforce.yml` (the repo had no CI at all). `hooks/pre-push.sample` plus `hooks/install-git-hooks.sh`, replacing SETUP.md step 3's prose description of a script that did not exist in the checkout.

**README reconciled.** Nine pre-existing errors fixed, including `enforce/` missing from the layout entirely and a `global-memory/user_profile.md` that has never existed in git history.

## 4. Pending

**Outstanding, user-side:**
- Name the `fixtures` job as a required status check under branch protection (Settings > Branches). Without it the ratchet is advisory, since a local hook is `--no-verify`-able. Green on six commits, so it will not block.
- doppelscript: `88cee3c` is merged but its `CLAUDE.md` line 33 asks for `/feature-cleanup` after a squash merge, which was not run.

**Adoption, per project (~15 min each):**
- Add the `.enforce.json` keys wanted (`naming` with a `glossary`, `fileHeaders`, `importZones`). Omitting `glossary` skips head-noun checking rather than passing it.
- `node ~/.claude/enforce/ratchet.mjs --update`, commit `.enforce-baseline.json`. Expect a large first baseline; that is the design.

**Untested, and only a real event will settle it:**
- doppelscript's Dependabot e2e skip. Every check on PR #359 ran as the maintainer, not as `dependabot[bot]`, so only the normal path is proven. The first real Dependabot PR tests whether a skipped job satisfies the required checks. If it blocks, delete the one `if:` in `ci.yml`.

**Open, unreproduced:**
- `enforce/tests/eslint.test.sh` failed once on the first run after a cold install and has passed every run since. The cold-`node_modules` hypothesis was tested directly (delete, reinstall, run immediately, twice) and eliminated. The one condition not reproduced is that the original install was network-bound at 5 minutes against 4 seconds warm, which points at contention during that install. Not worth more time without a second sighting.

## 5. Next-session tasks, with files to read

- **First real adoption of the lexicon.** Read `enforce/README.md` ("The naming lexicon"), pick one project, write its `glossary`, run the ratchet.
- **Do not mechanize R-318 or R-322.** The reasoning is recorded in each rule's Spec in `rulebook/reference.md`. A line-count proxy enforces a different rule than the one written, under that rule's id.
- **Do not hand-edit the R-316 verb bullets** in `rulebook/reference.md`. They are generated; change `enforce/lexicon.json` and run `node enforce/renderLexiconSpec.mjs --write`. The suite fails if they diverge.
- **When adding an enforcer,** R-516 still binds: a `manifest.json` entry naming tier and enforcer, plus a fixture under `enforce/tests/`. The manifest closure test will say so if you forget.
