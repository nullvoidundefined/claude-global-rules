# claude-global-rules

A personal operating system for Claude Code. Rules, hooks, audit roles, convention files, prompt templates, and cross-session memory, organized as an eleven-layer model: seven mechanically enforced layers (memory loading, plugin-shipped skills, hook scripts, per-turn and pre-push test gates, session-lifecycle hooks, secret-scan and redaction hooks, destructive-action guards) and four prose layers (audit role definitions, process sequencing, git hygiene, and the residue of the rules layer that no linter can decide). Any Claude Code session loads it at startup.

This repo is the canonical, version-controlled home for everything that governs how Claude behaves across every project the maintainer touches. It is loaded at the start of every session via `~/.claude/`. Individual projects extend and override specific sections through their own `CLAUDE.md` files, but the baseline lives here.

> **Read the criticism audit alongside the manifesto.** `PROTOCOL.md` presents the current eleven-layer framework. `docs/audits/2026-07-31-criticism.md` is the harshest critique of the harness to date (the inert judge tier, the dead effectiveness loop, speculative stack enforcement). Both are load-bearing; reconciling them is the work.

## What this is for

Claude Code is a capable agent. By default, it has no cross-session memory, no consistent behavior across projects, no mechanism to learn from prior mistakes, no enforcement of the user's voice and style preferences, and no safety net against the class of failures that LLM-driven development produces under pressure (confidence theater, deploying to debug, leaking secrets on argv, pasting em dashes into trust-critical output, losing track of which branch a commit will land on).

This repo is the scaffolding that turns Claude Code from "a fresh LLM every session" into "a colleague who remembers the rules, has been burned by specific incidents, and has guardrails that catch the classes of failure the rules alone cannot prevent."

It is built around a single principle: **most layers exist because a specific failure taught the maintainer where one was missing.** No rule is aspirational. Most hooks are wired to a real incident. The framework is not "best practices"; it is the scar tissue of one developer who got burned and decided to catalog every burn.

## Who it is for

Primarily the maintainer of this repo, who uses it across many projects spanning production, development, and template categories. It is shaped by that maintainer's specific preferences (no em dashes, no streaming, clean AI-tell-free output) and incident history (plaintext API key on argv, runbook-vs-code drift, optimism-driven bug fixes, parallel agent fan-out without a canary). Fork it and recalibrate to your own.

It is readable and adoptable by other Claude Code users with similar requirements. The hooks, role files, and convention pointers are generic enough to port; the maintainer-specific preferences are isolated to a small number of rules that can be stripped or replaced without touching the framework.

## What's mine vs. what's Anthropic's

The **runtime** is Anthropic's: Claude Code itself, the hook protocol, the plugin marketplace and loader, the skill tool, the MCP integration, the session lifecycle primitives, the slash-command system. This repo configures and extends that runtime; it does not implement it.

Most **plugins enabled in `settings.json`** are Anthropic-shipped through the official `@claude-plugins-official` marketplace:

- `superpowers`: Layer 2 (Skills) is almost entirely this plugin. It provides `brainstorming` (HARD-GATE before code), `writing-plans`, `executing-plans`, `subagent-driven-development`, `dispatching-parallel-agents`, `systematic-debugging`, `test-driven-development`, `verification-before-completion`, `requesting-code-review`, `receiving-code-review`, `using-git-worktrees`, `finishing-a-development-branch`. The framing of "skills as capabilities not prose" comes from Superpowers.
- `frontend-design`, `context7`, `code-review`, `code-simplifier`, `typescript-lsp`: the other Anthropic-shipped plugins enabled in this configuration. Each contributes its own skills, agents, and behaviors. `posthog` and `stripe` are declared in `settings.json` but set to `false`; they ship disabled.

One enabled plugin is **third-party**, from a separate marketplace declared in `extraKnownMarketplaces`:

- `i-have-adhd@i-have-adhd` ([ayghri/i-have-adhd](https://github.com/ayghri/i-have-adhd), MIT): an output-style skill that shapes responses for an ADHD reader (action first, numbered steps, state restated each turn, no preamble or recap). It sets `disable-model-invocation: true`, so nothing applies until `/i-have-adhd` is invoked. Its one `SessionStart` hook reads a flag file and `SKILL.md`, writes to stdout, and exits 0 on any failure; it stays inert unless `~/.claude/.i-have-adhd-always` exists, which is not created by installing. Being third-party, it sits outside `enforce/hook-hashes.txt`, which covers this repo's own `hooks/` and `enforce/` only, not `plugins/`.

Everything **inside this tracked repo** is the maintainer's: the 40 hook scripts under `hooks/` (plus `install-git-hooks.sh` and the tracked `pre-push.sample` it installs), the enforcement surface under `enforce/` (the rule manifest, the naming registry, four custom ESLint rules, the full-tree ratchet, and 43 fixture tests), the 10 convention files (`CLAUDE-*.md`, `CLOUD-DEPLOYMENT.md`), the audit role definitions under `agents/` and `audits/`, the 13 custom skills under `skills/` (separate from the plugin-shipped Superpowers skills), the 31 global-memory files, the R-001..R-906 rule formalization in `CLAUDE.md`, the eleven-layer synthesis in `PROTOCOL.md`, the promotion/retirement ladders, the fire/miss log convention, and the lifecycle wiring in `settings.json`. The synthesis (which Anthropic-shipped pieces to enable, how to wire them, what rules to codify around them) is also the maintainer's.

**Audit reports in `docs/audits/` are framework outputs, not authored prose.** Each report was produced by Claude playing the audit-role persona defined in `audits/<role>.md`. The framework audits itself; the dated files in `docs/audits/` are the outputs of running it. The maintainer wrote the role definitions and the audit cadence rules; Claude wrote the report text from those definitions.

## The eleven-layer model

The full framework is documented in [`PROTOCOL.md`](./PROTOCOL.md). At a glance, with each layer marked as mechanical (enforced by code, hooks, or auto-loading) or prose (rules and definitions; honor-system at runtime):

| Layer | Type | What it catches | Lives at |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1. Memory | mechanical | Context decay across sessions, re-learning the same lessons | `global-memory/INDEX.md` (read by `SessionStart` hook), `projects/<cwd>/memory/` |
| 2. Skills | mechanical | High-risk or high-leverage tasks done ad hoc instead of using a tested pattern | Anthropic-shipped `superpowers` plugin (brainstorming, plans, TDD, dispatching, debugging, verification) plus this repo's `skills/` |
| 3. Rules | mixed | Behavioral drift, forgotten conventions, ambiguous defaults | `CLAUDE.md` (this repo), per-project `CLAUDE.md`, `CLAUDE-*.md` convention files. The decidable half is data: the R-316/R-317 verb lexicon lives in `enforce/lexicon.json`, and R-319/R-320/R-325 are custom ESLint rules under `enforce/rules/`. The undecidable half (R-318, R-322) is labelled `[manual]` rather than pretending otherwise |
| 4. Audits | prose | Confidence theater, gaps invisible to the original author | `audits/` standing (Engineering, Security, Criticism) + `audits/on-request/` |
| 5. Tests | mechanical | Code that works until it does not, green dashboards built on confidence theater | Per-project test suites (unit, integration, E2E, smoke), run at turn end by `hooks/verification-gate.sh` (R-509) |
| 6. Hooks | mechanical | Behavioral rules that decay under pressure; mechanical at-the-tool-call layer | `hooks/`, wired in `settings.json` (44 scripts across 8 events) |
| 7. Process | prose | Each unit of work passes through every layer at least once | The rule corpus that sequences brainstorming, planning, execution, verification, commit, push, monitor |
| 8. Session lifecycle | mechanical | Cross-session drift, dirty state, lost context | `SessionStart` and `SessionEnd` hooks, handoff docs |
| 9. Secret handling | mechanical | Plaintext credentials on argv, in chat, in commits, in transcripts | `hooks/secret-scan.sh` (PreToolUse), `hooks/redact-output.sh` (PostToolUse), R-102..R-107 |
| 10. Git hygiene | mixed | History rewritten in ways that lose evidence; force-pushes to main; missing test pairs | `CLAUDE.md` R-5xx; `git-workflow-guard.sh`, `commit-message-guard.sh`, `conflict-markers.sh`, `fix-commit-requires-test.sh` |
| 11. Destructive-action guards | mechanical | Irreversible data loss against production or remote databases | `hooks/destructive-db-guard.sh`, R-101 |

Each layer assumes the next will catch what it misses. The discipline is not "follow every rule"; the discipline is "add the next layer the next time a failure teaches you where one is missing."

**On the mechanical/prose split.** Seven layers (Memory, Skills, Hooks, Tests, Lifecycle, Secret handling, Destructive-action guards) are enforced by code that runs whether the session remembers to invoke it or not. Two (Audits, Process) are prose. Two (Rules, Git hygiene) are mixed: mechanically enforced wherever the rule is decidable, prose where it is not.

The design goal is to migrate prose down to mechanical as enforcement paths get wired. The em-dash ban migrated when `no-em-dash.sh` shipped; the Tests layer migrated on 2026-09-04 when `verification-gate.sh` began blocking a turn from ending on a red suite; the naming rules migrated when the verb lexicon became a checked-in registry rather than a judgment.

**The migration has a floor, and saying so is part of the design.** A rule is mechanically enforceable exactly when its verdict is a pure function of `(AST, file paths, checked-in config)`. R-318 ("one responsibility per file") and R-322 (orchestrator versus atomic) are not: the only deterministic checks available are proxies such as line count, and a proxy enforces a different rule than the one written while reporting under the original rule's id. Both were taken off the LLM-judge tier on 2026-09-04 and labelled `[manual]`, because a non-deterministic verdict on an undecidable property is confidence theater rather than enforcement. The criticism audit referenced above tracks the rest.

## How a session uses this repo

1. **Session start.** Claude Code loads `~/.claude/settings.json`, which wires the `SessionStart` hooks. `session-start.sh` reads `global-memory/INDEX.md` and the project's `docs/session-handoff/session-handoff.md` (SHA-verified against git log before it is trusted) and emits both as additional context. `hook-integrity-check.sh` verifies the enforcement scripts against the committed hash manifest; `enforcement-guard-check.sh` verifies the manifest/settings/rulebook closure and warns if the llm-judge tier cannot run.
2. **Rules load.** `CLAUDE.md` is loaded into the session: one norm line per rule with its enforcer named inline, currently 59 rules in 100 lines. The 200-line cap is not a convention but a test: `enforce/tests/claude-md-lint.test.sh` fails the suite above it, and also fails on any rule id that has a Spec in `rulebook/reference.md` but no norm line in either `CLAUDE.md` or a skill (and vice versa), so the two cannot drift apart. The full Spec for every rule lives in `rulebook/reference.md`, read on demand and consumed mechanically by the enforcement guard and the push-time LLM judge.
3. **Work happens.** Every tool call passes through the relevant `PreToolUse` hooks. Bash commands are scanned for secrets and em dashes before execution. Write and Edit calls are scanned for em dashes. `git commit -m "fix: ..."` calls are inspected to confirm a test file is staged.
4. **Convention files load by path.** The stack `CLAUDE-*.md` files carry `paths:` frontmatter and are symlinked into `~/.claude/rules/`, so Claude Code loads each one mechanically when work touches matching files (a `.py` file pulls in the Python conventions, a `migrations/` file pulls in the database conventions). Only `CLOUD-DEPLOYMENT.md` remains a purely manual read.
5. **Audits run on schedule or on signal.** The standing three roles (Engineering, Security, Criticism) run pre-launch or when a specific risk signal surfaces. The five on-request roles run only when a specific situation calls for that lens.
6. **Session end.** The `SessionEnd` hook rolls the session's mechanical fire log (`telemetry/rule-fires.log`, appended by every deny/ask hook via `log-rule-fire.sh`) into `global-memory/rule_fires.md` as counted entries, and still scans per-project feedback memory for the `fired:`/`miss:` prefix convention from R-603. The session writes a handoff doc to `docs/session-handoff/session-handoff.md` (R-602) if outstanding work remains.

### Enforcement gates and egress disclosure

Five push-time gates guard `git push`: ESLint (TS), ruff (Python), RuboCop (Ruby), golangci-lint (Go), and an LLM rule judge. All fail open when their tool is unavailable and honor `enforce/exempt-repos.txt` (origin URL per line). Two trust boundaries are explicit: linters resolve from PATH or the harness bundle, never from the target repo (`bundle exec` is banned; the Go gate additionally requires the repo in `enforce/gate-trusted-repos.txt` because linting Go compiles the tree). **Egress:** when a key is available, `llm-rule-judge.sh` sends the outgoing diff of every non-exempt repo to `api.anthropic.com` at push time; without one it skips and the session-start guard says so. Key resolution: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` env, then the macOS keychain service `claude-judge-api-key`. Provision interactively so the value never touches shell history or a session transcript: `security add-generic-password -a "$USER" -s claude-judge-api-key -w` (prompts for the value hidden). A git `pre-push` hook runs both fixture suites before any push of this repo (installed from the tracked `hooks/pre-push.sample` by `hooks/install-git-hooks.sh`), `hooks/verification-gate.sh` blocks a turn from ending on a red suite (R-509), and `.github/workflows/enforce.yml` runs both suites plus the ratchet in CI, where `--no-verify` cannot reach them.

**Long-term drift.** A diff-scoped gate leaves the untouched majority of a codebase free to drift. `enforce/ratchet.mjs` runs every rule over the whole tree, records the count per rule in a committed `.enforce-baseline.json`, and fails when a count rises: existing debt is grandfathered, new debt is not, and the number only ever descends. Run it as a required status check on the protected branch, since a local hook is `--no-verify`-able and therefore advisory however it is written. See `enforce/README.md`.

## The self-reinforcement loop

The framework is designed to learn from itself. The loop:

```
work happens
  → mistakes write `miss: R-NNN ...` to feedback memory
  → successes write `fired: R-NNN ...` to feedback memory
  → SessionEnd hook appends dated entries to rule_fires.md / rule_misses.md
  → handoff doc surfaces promotion candidates and stale rules
  → next SessionStart auto-prints retirement candidates from the prior session
  → next session triages, promotes, demotes
  → CLAUDE.md updates with bumped Last validated dates and new/retired rules
  → loop continues
```

Promotion ladder for lessons:
```
ephemeral observation → feedback memory → global memory → CLAUDE.md rule → enforced hook
```

Each rung has a promotion criterion. Lessons climb as they earn their place. Rules that stop earning their place climb back down the retirement ladder. The goal is a CLAUDE.md file whose every rule is currently load-bearing, currently validated within the last 180 days, and either machine-enforced or on an honest 30-day grace period to ship enforcement.

The mechanics live in [`PROTOCOL.md`](./PROTOCOL.md); the fire and miss logs are in [`global-memory/`](./global-memory/).

## Design principles

These are the principles the framework defends, not a checklist. Each earned its place through an incident that would have been prevented if the principle had been load-bearing sooner.

- **Most layers exist because a specific failure taught the maintainer where one was missing.** No aspirational rules. No copy-paste from "best practices" blogs. If a rule cannot cite a failure it would have prevented or a rule it replaces, it does not belong in `CLAUDE.md`. Framework primitives (Memory, Skills, Process, Tests, Git hygiene) predate the incident catalog; the rest were earned the hard way.
- **Rules with no enforcement are a draft state, not a destination.** Honor-system rules decay under pressure. Every rule ships with a path to mechanical enforcement; until that path lands, the rule carries an "honor-system" marker so future sessions know the real state.
- **Golden path first, prohibitions second.** Rules describe the desired behavior, not the forbidden one. Prohibitions remain where they ARE the rule content (the em dash, the secret echo, the bypassed safety check), but the dominant voice is "do X," not "never Y."
- **Cost discipline is gated, not aspirational.** Audits run on schedule or on signal, never reactively. Retrospectives fire after incidents, not after every long session. Handoff docs stay under 8KB. Parallel agent fan-out waits for a canary. The goal is to ship; the framework is scaffolding to make shipping safer, not an end in itself.
- **Memory is project-scoped by default.** Cross-project lessons move to `global-memory/` only after proving themselves across 2+ project types and firing at least 3 times in the trailing 90 days. Client-specific information never crosses that boundary.
- **Audits report, they do not act.** The three standing audit roles (Engineering, Security, Criticism) have reporting authority within their scope. They can declare findings, refuse to soften, and recommend specific edits. They cannot commit code, modify settings, rotate credentials, or take irreversible steps. The user sees every finding and decides what to land.
- **Each layer assumes the next will catch what it misses.** No layer is individually sufficient. The chain is the safety mechanism, not any single component.

## Read this first (if you are new to the repo)

In order:

1. **[`CLAUDE.md`](./CLAUDE.md)**: the canonical rules file, one norm line per rule with its enforcer in brackets. Start here and read it whole; at 100 lines that is the cheapest orientation available. Full Specs live in [`rulebook/reference.md`](./rulebook/reference.md), read on demand.
2. **[`PROTOCOL.md`](./PROTOCOL.md)**: the eleven-layer framework. Read this when you want to understand why a layer exists or propose a new one.
3. **[`global-memory/INDEX.md`](./global-memory/INDEX.md)**: cross-project lessons. The `SessionStart` hook reads this automatically; you can also read it directly.
4. **[`agents/audit-engineering.md`](./agents/audit-engineering.md), [`agents/audit-security.md`](./agents/audit-security.md), [`agents/audit-criticism.md`](./agents/audit-criticism.md)**: the three standing audit role definitions, co-located with the agent frontmatter that Claude Code's Agent runtime loads at dispatch. The mirror files under `audits/` are pointers; the agent files are canonical. On-request roles (Customer, Design, UX, Financial, Legal, Marketing) live alongside as `agents/audit-<role>.md`.
5. **[`hooks/`](./hooks/)** and **[`enforce/README.md`](./enforce/README.md)**: the actual enforcement layer. Each hook is self-documenting in its header comment; `enforce/README.md` covers the rule manifest, the naming lexicon, the ratchet, and how to add a rule.
6. **[`docs/session-handoff/session-handoff.md`](./docs/session-handoff/)**: the most recent handoff, and the cheapest way to understand current state. Dated audit reports live in [`docs/audits/`](./docs/audits/).

## Using the same rules from Cursor and OpenAI Codex

The repository root is the Claude Code configuration (it is installed as `~/.claude`). Two sibling folders carry the same configuration in the shapes two other agents read, and both are generated from the root, so every rule is still written once:

- **`cursor/`** for Cursor: `.mdc` rules (always-on, glob-attached, or agent-requested), a `hooks.json`, subagents, slash commands, and all thirteen skills. `bash ~/.claude/cursor/install.sh` points `~/.cursor` at it.
- **`openai/`** for OpenAI Codex (the CLI, the IDE extension, and the cloud agent behind ChatGPT): a global `AGENTS.md`, a `hooks.json` in Claude Code's own schema, custom agent roles, and the skills plus the session procedures as skills. `bash ~/.claude/openai/install.sh` points `~/.codex` at it. ChatGPT's chat interface reads no files; the port is for the Codex agent it delegates to.

The hooks run unchanged under both tools. Each port has one adapter script (`cursor/hooks/claude-hook-adapter.sh`, `openai/hooks/codex-hook-adapter.sh`) that turns that tool's hook events into the Claude Code payloads the scripts already read and turns their decisions back, so 38 of the 42 hooks enforce under Cursor and 39 under Codex, along with the `Bash(...)` permission rules from `settings.json`. `enforce/tests/cursor-port.test.sh` and `enforce/tests/openai-port.test.sh` fail the suite when a port is stale or an adapter stops making the same decisions as the hooks. Fidelity per event and the caveats are in [`cursor/README.md`](./cursor/README.md) and [`openai/README.md`](./openai/README.md); the per-hook tables are the two `PORT-STATUS.md` files.

## Running this repo on your own machine

This repo is installed at `~/.claude/` and tracked by git. To bootstrap:

1. Clone the repo to `~/.claude/` (or a separate path and symlink).
2. Ensure Claude Code is installed.
3. Verify `jq`, `node`, and `python3` are available (`brew install jq node` on macOS); the hooks depend on all three. Then `npm install --prefix enforce`: `enforce/node_modules` is gitignored, so a fresh clone has none and the six ESLint-backed fixtures fail on a missing ESLint rather than on a real defect.
4. Verify `settings.json` hook paths resolve on your system. The hooks use `~/.claude/hooks/...` which assumes the repo is at `~/.claude/`.
5. Install the git hook: `bash hooks/install-git-hooks.sh`, which writes `.git/hooks/pre-push` from the tracked `hooks/pre-push.sample` and refuses to clobber a pre-push it did not write, naming the exact `mv` to run if you want it replaced. The one hook it replaces without asking is its own superseded predecessor, identified by that hook's header and backed up to `pre-push.legacy.bak` first. Regenerate the integrity manifest after any intentional change to a hook, a custom ESLint rule, or the lexicon: `hooks/hook-integrity-check.sh --update`.
6. Run a dry test: `bash enforce/tests/run-tests.sh && bash hooks/tests/run-tests.sh` (50 fixture tests), then start a session and confirm the `SessionStart` hook emits the global memory INDEX. Try a Write call containing U+2014 and confirm it blocks.
7. Recalibrate to yourself: R-906 (estimation) lives in `rulebook/cost.md`, R-903 (model routing) beside it, and the collaboration preferences are the `global-memory/feedback_*.md` files. `SETUP.md` covers which of those to keep, edit, or truncate on a fresh install.

The runtime directories (`sessions/`, `cache/`, `history.jsonl`, `paste-cache/`, `shell-snapshots/`) are gitignored and populated by Claude Code as you work.

Cost tracking: `/usage` and `/cost` in-session for the current plan window; `npx ccusage@latest` reads the local transcript logs for per-day and per-model spend history without installing anything.

## Contributing to this framework

This repo is shaped by incidents, not by feature requests. To propose a new rule, new hook, new audit role, or new layer:

1. **Cite the incident.** A proposal without a concrete incident it would have prevented is declined by default. "I think this would be good" is not a citation.
2. **Run the relevant audit first.** Most proposals are better addressed by adding a check to an existing audit role than by adding a new rule to `CLAUDE.md`. The three standing roles cover most ground.
3. **Design the enforcement before the rule.** Rules that ship without a path to mechanical enforcement are draft state. If the proposed rule cannot be enforced by a hook, lint, CI check, or audit scan, it is likely the wrong layer.
4. **Cut something when you add something.** `CLAUDE.md` loads on every session, so anything conditional belongs in a skill instead. The 200-line cap is enforced by `enforce/tests/claude-md-lint.test.sh`, which also fails if a rule's norm line and its `rulebook/reference.md` Spec drift apart.
5. **Ship the fixture with the rule.** R-516: every mechanizable rule needs a `manifest.json` entry naming its tier and enforcer, plus a fixture test under `enforce/tests/`. A rule with no manifest entry depends on recall, and the manifest closure test will say so.

## Version history and audit trail

The git history of this repo is the change log. Dated audit reports live in [`docs/audits/`](./docs/audits/); the current handoff is in [`docs/session-handoff/`](./docs/session-handoff/). The git history of this repo is the authoritative record of how the framework has evolved.

Notable milestones:

- **2026-04-07:** initial formal codification of session-lifecycle drift-prevention rules.
- **2026-04-08 (incident):** plaintext Anthropic API key leaked via a Railway CLI command line; the `secret-scan.sh` hook and the engineering audit's Credential Exposure Scan section landed the same day in response.
- **2026-04-08 (PROTOCOL.md):** ten-layer failure-mode catalog codified.
- **2026-04-08 (full CLAUDE.md rewrite):** Security + Criticism + Engineering audits triggered a full rewrite from 866 lines / 11K tokens to 459 lines / 6K tokens, ADDING the security guardrail layer the prior version lacked. Non-negotiable rules block, golden-path reframing, self-reinforcement loop, promotion / retirement ladders, fire and miss logs, Last validated timestamps. (The non-negotiable block, the TOC, the inline change log, and the per-rule timestamps were later folded away by the 2026-07-29 split that moved every Spec into `rulebook/reference.md`; this entry records what the April rewrite added, not the file's shape today.)
- **2026-09-04 (determinism pass):** the Tests layer went mechanical (`verification-gate.sh`, a Stop hook that blocks a turn from ending on a red suite, closing the R-509 hole where four push gates linted and nothing ran tests). Naming moved from the LLM judge onto a checked-in registry: `enforce/lexicon.json` decides verb membership, banned synonyms, and boolean prefixes, with the read and persistence verbs bound to the R-304 layer that gives them meaning so synonyms cannot be freely substituted. R-319/R-320/R-325 became custom ESLint rules. `ratchet.mjs` added the long-term half: full-tree counts against a committed baseline, so existing debt is grandfathered and new debt is not. `CLAUDE.md` dropped 17 conditional rules into the `structure-conventions` skill (15,129 to 11,738 characters off the always-loaded prompt), each still caught mechanically at the tool call. R-318 and R-322 were taken off the judge tier and labelled `[manual]`, because they are undecidable and a proxy would enforce a different rule. CI arrived (`.github/workflows/enforce.yml`); the repo had none.
- **2026-04-08 (Phase 2+3 batch):** shipped enforcement hooks (`no-em-dash`, `fix-commit-requires-test`, `session-start`, `session-end`) and the `subagent-branch-setup` reusable snippet. Moved 5 audit roles to on-request. Tightened the three standing role files from "advisory autonomy" to "reporting authority." This README and a session handoff doc.
